<h2>Questions</h2>

<p> a) Embedded systems need a loop since they are real-time devices. They always need to be ready to process information in real-time. <br>
       They need a setup since some variables (constants) and initalizations only need to be run once.<br>
    b) CPUs can only execute machine code, therefore a higher level language needs to be translated (or compiled) into a format that the CPU can understand.<br>
    c) When the frequency reaches 0, the period becomes undefined which causes a fault in the arduino. Even though the frequency is supposed to come back up, it doesn't because of the exception thrown by the arduino.
